                                <strong>Ash</strong> is a fast, maneuverable Warframe that possesses a high degree of
                                survivability in the
                                field. Fleet movement complements deadly tools of assassination, making Ash a perfect
                                balance between killing potency and stealth.

                            <p>
                                During the Orokin Era, there was a school of assassination called The Scoria. Each of
                                its
                                members bore a black jewel imprinted between their eyes and treated Ash as their patron
                                saint.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At one point during the Era, the school had two noteworthy students: brothers Dom and
                                Pilio.
                                Dom possessed great skill while Pilio was not as gifted, lacking his brother's grace and
                                clarity, but one day Dom was captured by his target. As capture by the enemy was
                                considered
                                an unforgivable sin to the Scoria, Pilio was given the task to assassinate his brother,
                                a
                                mission that would be overseen by Ash himself. However, Pilio would be torn from killing
                                his
                                brother, were he to succeed, or being killed by his idol, were he to fail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The pair was dispatched on a tower on Mars, but Pilio failed to overcome the fear that
                                his
                                task wrought, leaving Ash to slay the fifty guardsmen with his Causta Bow and
                                DualKamas
                                Dual Kamas. Ash led Pilio to their target's chambers, discovering Dom in civilian
                                clothes,
                                casually sharing a glass with a middle-aged mustachioed man whose eyes were sad and
                                kind,
                                and the gem between his eyes removed, signifying that he had betrayed the Scoria. The
                                man
                                gladly called Dom and Pilio his sons before coming to Dom's defense and brandishing a
                                sidearm, which was quickly disarmed by Ash's BladeStorm Blade Storm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Urged by Dom, a confused Pilio questioned Ash, who responded by sinking his blade into
                                Pilio's gem. The gem was suppressing the memories of Dom and Pilio DeNas, who were
                                stolen by
                                the Scoria. The mustachioed man, Lio DeNas, was stealing back his sons. Ash had saved
                                the
                                boy from his turmoil and allowed the DeNas family to escape from Mars forever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is unknown why Ash went against the school's doctrine. However, it is known that not
                                even
                                the Scoria were spared from their idol during the fall of the Orokin.
